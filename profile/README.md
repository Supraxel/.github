# Hello 👋

Welcome to the GitHub space of __Supraxel Studio__!

Our team is focused on crafting __Project Lima__ (working title) as well as contributing to the open source community.

## 🧑‍💻 Open source

While crafting Project Lima we put the emphasis on creating game-agnostic modules that could be used for other game projects (or even apps!).
Those modules would allow us to prototype many game ideas quickly.

Right now those modules are far from completely fulfill this ideal, but we build them brick by brick.

We welcome every contribution! 💖
