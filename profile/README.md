# Hello 👋

Welcome to the GitHub space of __Supraxel Games__!

We are focused on crafting our game __Project Lima__ (working title) and contribute (in the mean time) to the open source community.

## 🧑‍💻 Open source

While crafting Project Lima we put the emphasis on creating game-agnostic modules that could be used for other game projects (or even apps!).
Those modules would allow us to prototype many game ideas quickly.

Right now those modules are far from completely fulfill this ideal, but we build them brick by brick.

While the collaboration process is not yet in-place, we welcome every contribution! 💖

## 🎥 Streams

Every saturday 3PM-8PM CET, you can watch our lead programmer streaming some _[live coding sessions](https://www.twitch.tv/supraxelgames)_ of Project Lima.
