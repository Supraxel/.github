# Hello 👋

Welcome to the GitHub space of __Supraxel Games__!

Our two teams are focused on crafting __Project Lima__ and __Project Tokyo__ (working titles) as well as contributing to the open source community.

## 🧑‍💻 Open source

While crafting Project Lima and Project Tokyo we put the emphasis on creating game-agnostic modules that could be used for other game projects (or even apps!).
Those modules would allow us to prototype many game ideas quickly.

Right now those modules are far from completely fulfill this ideal, but we build them brick by brick.

We welcome every contribution! 💖

## 🎥 Streams

Every saturday 3PM-8PM CET, you can watch our lead programmer _Aurelio_ streaming some _[live coding sessions](https://www.twitch.tv/supraxelgames)_ of Project Lima.
